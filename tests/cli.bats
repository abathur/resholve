# This suite focuses on exercising basic usage of the resholver command, including
# - positional parameters
# - flags
# - environment variables
# - stdin/out
#
# It also demonstrates which invocations are equivalent.
#
# Conceptually, there's a lot of overlap between this task and what's done in demo.bats.
# But they're separated out for now so that we can run the demo differently to better
# capture its output and present it as an illustration of what resholved is for. In the
# longer run, better formal documentation may make it possible to merge cases covered
# by the demo into this file. In any case, if you add something to the demo--make sure
# it is also covered here. But not the inverse--the demo doesn't need to cover the same
# exact ground as thoroughly as this suite.
