RESHOLVE(1)                 General Commands Manual                RESHOLVE(1)

NAME
       resholve — resolve external command/script references in shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       resholve [options] script ...
       resholve [options] < script

DESCRIPTION
       resholve replaces bare references (subject to a PATH search at runtime)
       to external commands and scripts with absolute paths.

       This small super-power helps ensure script dependencies are declared,
       present, and don't unexpectedly shift when the PATH changes.

       resholve is developed to enable the Nix package manager to package and
       integrate Shell projects, but its features are not Nix-specific and in‐
       evitably have other applications.

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
       script
          •   given as input on <stdin>, write resolved script to <stdout>
          •   as a path, write to script.resolved (or script if --overwrite is
              used)

       --interpreter none | path
          The absolute interpreter path for the script's shebang. The special
          value none ensures there is no shebang.  See execve(2)

       --path path | RESHOLVE_PATH=path
          A PATH-format list of directories and/or files to resolve external
          dependencies from.  You may also use aliases --inputs or
          RESHOLVE_INPUTS

OPTIONS
       --fake directives
       --fix directives
       --keep directives
          Adjust how resolution is performed. See “CONTROLLING RESOLUTION”.

       --lore directory
       --execer statements
       --wrapper statements
          Adjust when nested resolution is performed. See “NESTED RESOLUTION”.

       --overwrite
          Resolve script in-place (useful for out-of-tree builds).

       --help
          Show brief syntax help.

       --version
          Show version number.

CONTROLLING RESOLUTION
       If resholve can't figure something out, you can often help it along
       with a mix of fake, fix, and keep directives. If quoted, directives can
       be separated by a space: 'directive[ directive]...'

       --fake 'directives' | RESHOLVE_FAKE='directives'
          Pretend some commands exist. There are 2 directive forms:

          type:name[;name]...
             Treat name(s) of type as defined; type is the full word or first
             letter of: alias, builtin, external, function, keyword, or source

          Ex: --fake 'f:setUp;tearDown builtin:setopt source:/etc/bashrc'

       --fix 'directives' | RESHOLVE_FIX='directives'
          Fix things we can't auto-fix/ignore. There are 5 directive forms:

          $variable:command (Note: $ may need escaping)
             replace parameter expansions of $variable with command

          absolute_path
             treat absolute_path as a bare reference that must be resolved

          aliases
             resolve into alias definitions

          command
             (nix-only) ignore security-wrapper error for command

          Ex: --fix 'aliases $GIT:gix /bin/bash'

       --keep 'directives' | RESHOLVE_KEEP='directives'
          Keep things we can't auto-fix/ignore. There are 6 directive forms:

          command:$variable[;$variable]... (Note: $ may need escaping)
             ignore $variable in the arguments to command

          $variable (Note: $ may need escaping)
             ignore $variable or ${variable} used as all or part of a first
             word (command)

             Such as: ‘$GIT status‘ or ‘$BUSYBOX/ls‘

          absolute_path
             ignore a specific absolute_path

          ˜/path
             ignore a specific home-relative_path

          ./path
             ignore a specific PWD-relative_path

          Ex: --keep 'source:$HOME /etc/bashrc ˜/.bashrc'

NESTED RESOLUTION
       Initially, resolution of commands in the arguments to command-executing
       commands was limited to one level for a hard-coded list of builtins and
       external commands. Version 0.6.0 (June 2021) adds recursive resolution.

       This task is complex. The main components of the current approach are:

       •   To pick out a sub-command among other flags, options, and argu‐
           ments, resholve has a small collection per-command rules.

           This collection will need to grow, but I only intend to include
           fairly-common commands. I'm not sure yet if there will be a user-
           facing mechanism for customizing this; I'm not sure the current im‐
           plementation is fully-baked, and I'd like to see how often it's
           needed. If you encounter instances of commands you think deserve
           explicit support, please report them.

       •   To meet the goal of blocking builds when all dependencies are not
           known, resholve needs a way to discover command-executing executa‐
           bles that it lacks per-command rules for (a sub-command might be
           present, but it is unable to disambiguate).

           The discovery process is outsourced. Only the result--a directory
           of "lore"--is passed via the --lore flag or RESHOLVE_LORE.

           resholve requires lore for every executable it finds in a script.
           See “Lore” for more on this format.

       Nested resolution is much more rigorous--but (at least for now) it adds
       complexity that some users will need to wrestle with.

   Lore
       Outsourcing discovery makes it easy to save/cache this lore and avoid
       repeating expensive work each run. It also makes it possible to hand-
       write or even generate it with tools that meet your own needs.

       Most users of the Nix API should be spared from needing to understand
       lore in detail. It automatically uses binlore
       (https://github.com/abathur/binlore) to generate lore for the executa‐
       bles in each input's bin/ directory, merge them into a combined copy,
       and pass it via RESHOLVE_LORE. If you find mis-identified executables,
       please report them to the binlore project.

       On the command-line, you can supply lore directly with two flags:

       --execer 'directives' | RESHOLVE_EXECER='directives'
          Each execer-lore directive indicates whether an executable sub-exe‐
          cutes its arguments with a verdict:abspath pair, where verdict is
          one of can, cannot, or might. This information enables resholve to
          raise an error when it encounters a command with a can|might verdict
          unless it has rules for figuring out whether the invocation includes
          a nested command.

       --wrapper 'directives' | RESHOLVE_WRAPPER='directives'
          Each wrapper-lore directive indicates whether one executable is just
          an exec wrapper for another with a wrapper_abspath:wrapped_abspath
          pair.  resholve uses this information to substitute the wrapped exe‐
          cutable's verdict whenever it encounters a wrapper. (Executables are
          often wrapped in nixpkgs, but it's also common in packages. In gnu‐
          grep, for example, both egrep and fgrep are wrappers of grep.)

ENVIRONMENT
       Most options can also be passed via environment variables. For example,
       all of the following are supported:

       RESHOLVE_INTERPRETER
       RESHOLVE_PATH
       RESHOLVE_FAKE
       RESHOLVE_FIX
       RESHOLVE_KEEP
       RESHOLVE_LORE
       RESHOLVE_EXECER
       RESHOLVE_WRAPPER
       RESHOLVE_PROLOGUE
       RESHOLVE_EPILOGUE
       RESHOLVE_OVERWRITE

EXIT STATUS
       The resholve utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

       Error statuses are not yet systematic or stable (use them if they help
       you--but expect changes). Generally:

       1   non-resholve error (ex: from the OSH parser)

       2   invocation/argument error

       3+  resolution error

EXAMPLES
       Basic invocations:

       $ resholve --interpreter "$(which bash)" --path "$PATH" script.sh
       $ resholve --interpreter "$(which bash)" --path "$PATH" < script.sh
       $ resholve --interpreter "$(which bash)" --path "$PATH" script1.sh script2.sh

LIMITATIONS
       •   resholve is built on the bash-compatible OSH parser (from the Oil
           shell project). It can't handle any script OSH can't parse.

       •   Support for non-bash shells is a happy side-effect of how similar
           POSIX-ish shell languages are. If you run into a parse error with
           any non-bash syntax, your only real option is changing the script.

       •   If you run into a parse error with valid bash syntax, check Oil's
           issue tracker (https://github.com/oilshell/oil/issues) to see if
           the issue is known and whether it is likely to be fixed. If it
           won't be fixed, your only recourse is changing the script.
