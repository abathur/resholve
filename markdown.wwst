  This will hopefully make its way into the Nixpkgs manual soon, but
  until then I'll outline how to use the `resholvePackage`, `resholveScript`,
  and `resholveScriptBin` functions.

  ## API Concepts

  The main difference between `resholvePackage` and other builder functions
  is the `solutions` attrset, which describes which scripts to resolve and how.
  Each "solution" (k=v pair) in this attrset describes one resholve invocation.

  > NOTE: For most shell packages, one invocation will probably be enough:
  > - Packages with a single script will only need one solution.
  > - Packages with multiple scripts can still use one solution if the scripts
  >   don't require conflicting directives.
  > - Packages with scripts that require conflicting directives can use multiple
  >   solutions to resolve the scripts separately, but produce a single package.

  The `resholveScript` and `resholveScriptBin` functions support a _single_
  `solution` attrset. This is basically the same as any single solution in `resholvePackage`, except that it doesn't need a `scripts` attr (it is automatically added).

  ## Basic `resholvePackage` Example

  Here's a simple example of how `resholvePackage` is already used in nixpkgs:

  <!-- TODO: figure out how to pull this externally? -->

  #insert[language=nix] ../nixpkgs/pkgs/tools/misc/dgoss/default.nix

  ## Basic `resholveScript` and `resholveScriptBin` examples

  Both of these functions have the same basic API. This example is a little
  trivial for now. If you have a real usage that you find helpful, please PR it.

  #insert[language=nix] resholveScript.example.nix

  ## Options

  `resholvePackage` maps Nix types/idioms into the flags and environment variables
  that the `resholve` CLI expects. Here's an overview:

  %select#options.table{arguments}

  <!-- TODO: section below is largely custom for nixpkgs, but I would LIKE to wurst it. -->

  ## Controlling resolution with directives

  In order to resolve a script, resholve will make you disambiguate how it should
  handle any potential problems it encounters with directives. There are currently
  3 types:
  1. `fake` directives tell resholve to pretend it knows about an identifier
     such as a function, builtin, external command, etc. if there's a good reason
     it doesn't already know about it. Common examples:
     - builtins for a non-bash shell
     - loadable builtins
     - platform-specific external commands in cross-platform conditionals
  2. `fix` directives give resholve permission to fix something that it can't
     safely fix automatically. Common examples:
     - resolving commands in aliases (this is appropriate for standalone scripts
       that use aliases non-interactively--but it would prevent profile/rc
       scripts from using the latest current-system symlinks.)
     - resolve commands in a variable definition
     - resolve an absolute command path from inputs as if it were a bare reference
  3. `keep` directives tell resholve not to raise an error (i.e., ignore)
     something it would usually object to. Common examples:
     - variables used as/within the first word of a command
     - pre-existing absolute or user-relative (~) command paths
     - dynamic (variable) arguments to commands known to accept/run other commands

  > NOTE: resholve has a (growing) number of directives detailed in `man resholve`
  > via `nixpkgs.resholve`.

  Each of these 3 types is represented by its own attrset, where you can think
  of the key as a scope. The value should be:
  - `true` for any directives that the resholve CLI accepts as a single word
  - a list of strings for all other options
  <!--
  TODO: these should be fully-documented here, but I'm already maintaining
  more copies of their specification/behavior than I like, and continuing to
  add more at this early date will only ensure that I spend more time updating
  docs and less time filling in feature gaps.

  Full documentation may be greatly accellerated if someone can help me sort out
  single-sourcing. See: https://github.com/abathur/resholve/issues/19
  -->

  This will hopefully make more sense when you see it. Here are CLI examples
  from the manpage, and the Nix equivalents:

  #insert[language=nix] directive.example.nix

  > **Note:** For now, at least, you'll need to reference the manpage to completely understand these examples.

  ## Controlling nested resolution with lore

  Initially, resolution of commands in the arguments to command-executing
  commands was limited to one level for a hard-coded list of builtins and
  external commands. resholve can now resolve these recursively.

  This feature combines information (_lore_) that the resholve Nix API
  obtains via binlore ([nixpkgs](../../tools/analysis/binlore), [repo](https://github.com/abathur/resholve)),
  with some rules (internal to resholve) for locating sub-executions in
  some of the more common commands.

  - "execer" lore identifies whether an executable can, cannot,
    or might execute its arguments. Every "can" or "might" verdict requires
    either built-in rules for finding the executable, or human triage.
  - "wrapper" lore maps shell exec wrappers to the programs they exec so
    that resholve can substitute an executable's verdict for its wrapper's.

  > **Caution:** At least when it comes to common utilities, it's best to treat
  > overrides as a stopgap until they can be properly handled in resholve and/or
  > binlore. Please report things you have to override and, if possible, help
  > get them sorted.

  There will be more mechanisms for controlling this process in the future
  (and your reports/experiences will play a role in shaping them...) For now,
  the main lever is the ability to substitute your own lore. This is how you'd
  do it piecemeal:

  #insert[language=nix] lore.example.nix

  The format is fairly simple to generate--you can script your own generator if
  you need to modify the lore.
