# resholve references to external dependencies in shell scripts

![Test](https://github.com/abathur/resholve/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

resholve replaces references to a bash/shell script's external 
dependencies (commands and sourced scripts) with absolute paths, ensuring
they are declared, present, and don't shift if PATH changes.

Comparisons:
- a linker for bash scripts
- [patchelf](https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf) for shell scripts

It treats references it can't resolve as build-blocking errors
until you tell it how to handle them, and then rewrites the script.

## Wait, what?

Fair! It took me a while to figure out resholve should exist, myself. 
If you aren't sure you need it, you *probably* don't. Still, you should
read a *bit* further so you'll recognize the needs resholve meets if you
encounter them someday :)

(If you change your mind from here on, please open an issue to help me 
understand how you're thinking about this and refine the intro.)

- If you want to understand what problems resholve addresses, read the next section.
- If you want to see invocations and output, the [Demos](demos.md) document is a good place to start.

## What problem(s) does this solve?

resholve is a generic tool, but I'm building it so [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/)/[Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) can have have great shell packaging.

In the Nix ecosystem, resholve is already helping us:
- discover and declare dependencies at package time instead of after runtime failures
    - keep unexpected versions of an executable or script from causing undefined behavior
- avoid polluting PATH with all of a script's dependencies, which also means
    - no conflicts between tools different scripts need on PATH
    - no conflicts with other packages a user expects on PATH
    - no implicit dependency on the content of fragile rc/profile scripts
- work directly with "normal" shell scripts
    - no polluting *source* scripts with template variables/syntax
    - no inlining shell scripts to readily inject absolute paths
    - no fragile .patch files
    - no fragile sed/awk text substitutions that might over-match

(Please open a PR/issue to document uses you discover!)

## Quickstart
> *Note:* resholve *works for a living*, but it is young. For example, it is *only* packaged for the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/). You may want to review the [limitations](#limitations) section for more.

Here's how to get resholve to play with it. You should also review `man resholve` (or the [plaintext](docs/resholve.1.txt) copy).

### CLI

```shell
nix-shell -p resholve
```

### Nix builder
The best documentation on the Nix builder is currently in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/misc/resholve/README.md).

### DIY

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abathur/resholve.git
cd resholve
nix-shell
# I recommend nix-shell for 'man resholve' support
```

## Acknowledgements
- resholve leverages the [Oil](https://github.com/oilshell/oil) shell's OSH parser) and wouldn't be feasible without Andy Chu's excellent work on that project.

## Limitations
We can't all be perfect :)

### Documentation
- The manpage is currently the canonical reference to resholve's options and behavior; the only online format is [plaintext](resholve.1.txt). See https://github.com/abathur/resholve/issues/19.

### Packaging
- My short-term goal is to support packaging shell projects for the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/). As such, the current build process depends on Nix. 
    - The Nix API probably isn't granular enough, yet.
- *If you're interested in using resholve without Nix, I'll appreciate contributions that fill in build support for other environments.*
- For simplicity, resholve uses nixpkgs' python2 rather than Oil's fork of python2. This may cause subtle problems.

### Known Gaps & Edge Cases in the utility itself

Because Shell is a very flexible, tricky language, resholve necessarily focuses on low-hanging-fruit tasks. Some of these will inevitably be supported over time, while others may stay out of reach. Please open an issue if you find a new one (and can't find an existing issue first).

The main areas I'm currently aware of:

- In any Nix build, resholve now blocks resolution of some fundamental external utilities (such as su and sudo) that use run wrappers in NixOS. See https://github.com/abathur/resholve/issues/29 for more.
- Because resholve makes assumptions about the behavior of some builtins in order to resolve scripts, it blocks if it looks like one is overridden by a function or alias. (This can likely be relaxed once I have a better sense of who/what/when/where/why/how these are overridden).
- resholve doesn't have robust handling of variables that get executed like commands (this includes things like `eval $variable` and `"$run_as_command"` and `$GIT_COMMAND status`). There's some room for improvement here, but I also want to manage expectations because some cases are completely intractable without evaluating the script.
    - there's a first-level complication about seeing-through the variables themselves
    - and then a second-level issue with seeing-through double-quoted strings (for example, an eval )
- `fc -s` has interesting behavior that makes it hard to account for
    - if I run `ls /tmp` and then `echo blah` and then `fc -s 'ls'`, it'll re-run that previous ls command
        - if resholve rewrites ls to an absolute path, the fc -s command won't work as expected unless we also expand the ls inside the fc command
    - if I run `ls /tmp` and then `fc -s tmp=sbin`, it'll run `ls /sbin`; if I then run `fc -s ls=stat`, it runs `stat /sbin`
        - accounting for and triaging this will be very hard; there are no strict semantics here; we can substitute arbitrary text which could be executable names or arguments or even just parts of them; we'd have to be very explicitly parsing things out, or maybe extracting them into a mock test and running it, to know what to do
    - For now this is unaddressed. It probably makes the most sense to just raise a warning about not handling fc and link to a doc or issue about it, but I'm inclined to put this off until someone asks about it.
